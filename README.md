# Q-Learning Project

The intended purpose of this project was to create a snake-like game that teaches itself to play and achieve the best score 
within a user-determined time interval (In this example we chose 15 seconds). This was achieved using reinforcement learning
with a Q-learning approach.

**python Agent.py** to start the game training.

The 'snakehead' agent will train for 1,000 games with no visuals shown. Then an output of statistics on how the
snake did will be displayed for the first 1,000 games. Following that the snake will proceed to train even more but 
on screen for viewers to see its progress. [As shown in the video]
